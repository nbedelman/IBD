Running a number of slim simulations for IBD project with Carl and Pavitra. Interested in the purging of introgressed deleterious variants as a function of overall recombination.

Slim takes config files, so will make a config template which can be edited with variables passed through command line arguments, similar to what I did with QuIBL.
